# Assignments :sparkles:
This is repo built for me, to store all the assignments I have done as apart of my University course. 

## Who is this repo for ? :boom:
This repo is mostly for me. I, like many of you, host my code on GitHub for reasons of portability, ease of work, and peace of mind. Beyond my own needs, I have also open-sourced this repo for you, the reader (and most likely developer), to explore the things that make my site tick.

If you like my work, please Star ðŸŒŸ the repo. If you find any suggestions/typos ping me or you can drop a PR here.
